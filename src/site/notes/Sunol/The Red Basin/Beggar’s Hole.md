A deep aquifer, known to locals only as 'Sanctuary', around which a small settlement is built forms the inner [[Sunol/The Red Basin/Red Basin\|desert]] town of Beggar's Hole, deep in the [[Sunol/The Red Basin/Red Basin\|Red Basin]].

The town has some infrastructure - mostly a way to get water, some guarding around the opening of the aquifer to protect the towns life-source, a tavern, and stables. There are also places for merchant carts to set up, and some permanent structures in town that are used to have some measure of normal life and to find shade.
 
A lot of merchant carts post around it the Sanctuary Market and the outside of Beggar's Hole, which rotate frequently as one cart leaves to go back to [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Brightstone\|Brightstone]] or [[Sunol/The Red Basin/Vein's End\|Vein's End]], another takes it place leaving Beggar's Hole constantly populated.
