A poorly maintained trade road, The Blazing Steps, runs through the [[Sunol/The Red Basin/Red Basin\|Red Basin]] desert. Harsh winds and shifting sands leave it covered, and almost impossible to follow, as you stray away from major cities and settlements.

The northernmost tip of the Blazing Steps starts at the gates of [[Sunol/The Red Basin/Vein's End\|Vein's End]], trailing through the whole [[Sunol/The Red Basin/Red Basin\|Red Basin]] until it reaches [[Sunol/Central Sunol/The Gateway\|The Gateway]] and the gates to [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Brightstone\|Brightstone]] in the south.

The Blazing Steps are a winding and treacherous path, about 440 miles long, and would take almost three weeks to travel at a normal pace on horseback. With the nature of the desert, it more often takes four to five weeks, and can take months to traverse with a caravan.
