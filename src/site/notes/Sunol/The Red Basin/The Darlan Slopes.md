The Darlan Slopes, an expansive mountain range at the far North of [[Sunol/Sunol\|Sunol]], is largely unexplored - it’s hard enough to get through the [[Sunol/The Red Basin/Red Basin\|Red Basin]], let alone to keep going. The sharp peaks notably lack any ice at their tips, presumably heated from below by [[Sunol/Sunolusite\|Sunolusite]], much like the [[Sunol/The Red Basin/Red Basin\|Red Basin]] desert itself. The rich veins of [[Sunol/Sunolusite\|Sunolusite]] can be seen by the naked eye when viewing the slopes from the desert.

Many mining shafts stretch out below the Darlan Slopes, but due to the steepness of the peaks, they’re rarely, if ever, traversed from above.
