Originally a [[Sunol/Races#Dwarves\|Dwarven]] Settlement called “Agaeth Orhim”, Meaning ‘Sand Home’ in [[Sunol/Races#Dwarves\|Dwarvish]], the city widely known as Vein's End sits carved out of the base of [[Sunol/The Red Basin/The Darlan Slopes\|The Darlan Slopes]], at the edge of The [[Sunol/The Red Basin/Red Basin\|Red Basin]]. It houses around 35,000 people full time, with that number fluctuating wildly with workers and merchants moving in and out, and visitors coming year-round. [[Sunol/Sunolusite\|Sunolusite]] veins can be seen running through [[Sunol/The Red Basin/The Darlan Slopes\|The Darlan Slopes]], ending at the high walls surrounding Vein’s End and giving the city its name.

Over 350 years ago the city was a [[Sunol/Races#Dwarves\|Dwarven]] settlement that was mysteriously abandoned, and re-settled by plucky [[Sunol/Races#Humans\|humans]] and half-human [[Sunol/Races#Tieflings\|tiefling]] outcasts, looking to establish a mining outpost. After the re-settlement, [[Sunol/Races#Dwarves\|Dwarves]] from small villages throughout the [[Sunol/The Red Basin/Red Basin\|Red Basin]] moved back in alongside them. The city is now 30% [[Sunol/Races#Humans\|human]], 30% [[Sunol/Races#Dwarves\|dwarf]], 25% [[Sunol/Races#Tieflings\|tiefling]], and 15% various [[Sunol/Races#Other Races\|other races]], according to the last census.

Most people living within Vein's End are actively working as miners, mainly for [[Entities/The Stone Factory\|The Stone Factory]] or [[Entities/Silver Plate Gemstones\|Silver Plate Gemstones]]. These two entites employ almost 60% of all workers in Vein's End, making the locals relatively poor. However, visitors to the city are mostly rich mine owners who live in [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Brightstone\|Brightstone]] and make the trek out to observe their worksites, wealthy merchants who are paid handsomely to cart [[Sunol/Sunolusite\|Sunolusite]] and other gemstones from Vein's End to [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Central Sunol\|Central]] and [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/Southern Sunol\|Southern Sunol]] for sale and export, and travellers who come to enjoy the lavish hotels and casinos, like [[Entities/The Jester's Coin\|The Jester's Coin]], that were built for the wealthy merchants and mine owners to spend their time at when visiting.

Due to the difficulty of reaching the city and the large disparity in wealth between the inhabitants and visitors, crime is rampant at Vein's End. Many casinos and taverns service the miners, visitors, and the people of the surrounding desert settlements, and drug usage here is higher than anywhere else on the continent. In recent years, the [[Sunol/The Royal Court\|crown]] has had little interest in curbing the lawlessness of the city and times have gotten harder for those living out there.

[[Guilds/Twin Rats Adventurers Guild\|Twin Rats Adventurers Guild]] takes it upon itself to do most of the policing for the more lawful parts of Vein's End.

Districts
###### The Waterway
The nicest housing in Vein's End is found in The Waterway, especially to the northeast. This district has some nice shops and houses most of the fine tradespeople of the desert. The name of this district alludes to the fact that this is where most of the water infrastructure for Vein's End is maintained, allowing for many communal bathing pools in this part of the city.
###### Jester's Hall
Jester's Hall has nice housing and [[Entities/The Jester's Coin\|The Jester's Coin]] Casino, the main attraction for many coming out to visit the desert. It is also home to many pubs and taverns, and places of other sorts of entertainment.
###### Sand Gate
The Sand Gate is an area of slums outside of the one gate into Vein's end, and the more run down housing just inside. Along [[Sunol/The Red Basin/The Blazing Steps\|The Blazing Steps]] as you enter the city some nicer houses and shops for the area reside.
###### Old Courts
The Old Courts has more slums, and notably a lot of ramshackle housing in old ruins. It also holds the large ruins of an old [[Sunol/Races#Dwarves\|Dwarven]] castle that descends into the [[Sunol/The Red Basin/The Darlan Slopes\|The Darlan Slopes]]. There are also rumours of a significant [[x.my stuff/The Black Market\|Black Market]] run out of some of the ruins.
###### The Scrapyards
The Scrapyards is a large district of low-middle income housing, where most of the miners live. It also has the [[Sunol/The Red Basin/Oasis Markets\|Oasis Markets]] at the center of the city, the largest and most bustling marketplace in the entire [[Sunol/The Red Basin/Red Basin\|Red Basin]], good taverns, and the [[Guilds/Twin Rats Adventurers Guild\|Twin Rats Adventurers Guild]]. This guild takes it upon itself to do most of the policing for the more lawful parts of Vein's End.
