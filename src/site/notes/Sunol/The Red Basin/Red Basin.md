The Red Basin is a massive and slowly spreading desert reaching from [[Sunol/The Red Basin/The Darlan Slopes\|The Darlan Slopes]] to almost touch [[Sunol/Central Sunol/The Sky Gates\|The Sky Gates]] mountain range separating the North from [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Central Sunol\|Central]] and [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/Southern Sunol\|Southern Sunol]]. The desert is believed to be formed and spread by the heat produced underground by rich veins of [[Sunol/Sunolusite\|Sunolusite]].

A number of settlements are dispersed throughout the desert. These settlements are primarily [[Sunol/Races#Dwarves\|Dwarven]] and [[Sunol/Races#Tieflings\|Tiefling]], but [[Sunol/Races#Migrants\|other races]], particularly less common races who have sought refuge but found none to the south, have also set up small communities around oasis' in the desert.

###### I Thiryn
I Thiryn, elvish for ‘The Guards’, stand guard at the entrance to the Red Basin.

Two giant, freestanding stone guards, one [[Sunol/Races#Eladren\|Eladren]] warrior and one [[Sunol/Races#Humans\|Human]] mage, stand facing the desert with their backs to [[Sunol/Central Sunol/The Gateway\|The Gateway]]. The Guards stand almost 600 feet tall. Visibility is low in the shifting sands of the Red Basin, thus many travellers report feeling that the giant guards have ‘snuck up’ on them.
