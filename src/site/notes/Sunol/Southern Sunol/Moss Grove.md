Moss Grove is an area of relatively dense and wild forest near the city of [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Eversun\|Eversun]], nestled between the [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/Dawn River Woodlands\|Dawn River Woodlands]] and [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/The Kingswood\|The Kingswood]].

It is a popular visiting place of the wealthy of [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Eversun\|Eversun]], with idyllic rivers and lakes on the northern side nearest the city. It is partly run through by [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/Hallam's Climb\|Hallam's Climb]], which allows for easy access for day guests. Further south the grove becomes more wild and less fully explored.
