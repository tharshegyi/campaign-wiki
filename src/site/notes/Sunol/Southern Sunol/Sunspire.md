The historical seat of power for the [[Characters/The Court/King William Ambrose\|Ambrose]] family is the lands of Sunspire, a large fortified castle built some 1400 years ago, high up on the side of [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/King's Mount\|King's Mount]] with a small city inside of and spilling out of the walls. A large peaked spire from the Old Castle dominates the landscape, cresting the mountain and glowing with amber [[Sunol/Sunolusite\|Sunolusite]] windows when the sun hits as it clears the mountains peak, making the building  look like a glowing lighthouse atop the mountain. The Sunspire can be seen from almost 100 miles away when glowing brightly.

It is the centre of a small, self-sufficient city of some 17,000 citizens, that primarily lives off garden vegetables and small farms of goats. Foraging around and at the base of the mountain is rich with medicinal plants, particularly in [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/The Witches Woods\|The Witches Woods]], thus many healers train here and at the base of the mountain in [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/Annette's Rest\|Annette's Rest]]. Other families specialise in trade, making the trip down [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/Hallam's Climb\|Hallam's Climb]] to [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Eversun\|Eversun]] to sell foraged and farmed wares every few months, and coming home to Sunspire and [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/Annette's Rest\|Annette's Rest]] to live a simple life.
