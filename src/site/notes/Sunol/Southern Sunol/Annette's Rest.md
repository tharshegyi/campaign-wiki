Annette’s Rest is named after [[Characters/The Court/King William Ambrose\|King William Ambrose]]’s 28x Great grandfather Hallam's (who built [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/Hallam's Climb\|Hallam's Climb]]) wife, who rested in a small unnamed town on the way home and taught some of the locals about healing.

It is a centre for celebration during [[Holidays and Festivals/Autumn Equinox\|Autumn Equinox]], when followers of [[Beiria/The Gods/The Healer\|The Healer]] gather here to enter [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/The Witches Woods\|The Witches Woods]] and begin the largest harvest of medicinal supplies of the year.
