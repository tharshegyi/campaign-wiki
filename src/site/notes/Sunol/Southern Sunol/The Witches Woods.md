The Witches Woods is a wild land at the furthest point south of continental [[Sunol/Sunol\|Sunol]]. It sits below [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/The Kingswood\|The Kingswood]] and [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/King's Mount\|King's Mount]], overlooked by [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/Sunspire\|Sunspire]].

It is an evergreen forest much like [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/The Kingswood\|The Kingswood]] above, however is distinguished by its significant underbrush that is widely known for the growth of many plants that are used in the creation of alchemical healing potions. These woods are frequented by traditional healers out of [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/Annette's Rest\|Annette's Rest]], who collect these herbs to train healers, produce medicines, and distribute across [[Sunol/Sunol\|Sunol]].

Firbogs are known to live in the far south of The Witches Woods, where they keep their own towns. They have a close working relationship with the townsfolk of [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/Annette's Rest\|Annette's Rest]], and sometimes integrate into Sunolian society.
