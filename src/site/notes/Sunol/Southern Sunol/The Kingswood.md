The Kingswood is a large stretch of simple evergreen forest with little undergrowth. It nestles between the tamed edge of [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/Moss Grove\|Moss Grove]] in the north, [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/King's Mount\|King's Mount]] in the west, and [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/The Witches Woods\|The Witches Woods]] on the southern end.

[[Sunol/Southern Sunol/Hallam's Climb\|Hallam's Climb]] runs right through the middle of The Kingswood, which makes this area an attractive place for bandits to attack caravans, using the year-round foliage as cover.

It is also a popular hunting place for citizens of both [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Eversun\|Eversun]] and [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/Sunspire\|Sunspire]], for rich and poor alike.
