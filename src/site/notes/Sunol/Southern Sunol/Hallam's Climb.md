Hallam's Climb is the long road down the [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/King's Mount\|King's Mount]] from [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/Sunspire\|Sunspire]] all the way to the main city [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Eversun\|Eversun]]. Named after [[Characters/The Court/King William Ambrose\|King William Ambrose]]’s 28x Great grandfather Hallam Ambrose, who built the road to [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Eversun\|Eversun]] some 900 years ago to allow for greater trade from the port. 

Hallam’s Climb takes a mostly wild path, except at the base of the [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/King's Mount\|King's Mount]], where it passes through [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/Annette's Rest\|Annette's Rest]]. This makes the town a popular resting place, as it once was for King Hallam’s wife Annette, for those taking Hallam’s Climb to and from [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/Sunspire\|Sunspire]]. 

The secluded nature of Hallam’s Climb can make it a dangerous place for the many caravans that travel its length between [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/Sunspire\|Sunspire]] and [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Eversun\|Eversun]].

Hallam’s Climb is about 775 miles long through [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/The Kingswood\|The Kingswood]], and would take approximately 4.5 weeks to travel on horseback, up to twice as long on foot.
