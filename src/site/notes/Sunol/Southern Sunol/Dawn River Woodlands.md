The Dawn River Woodlands is a sprawling landscape from the base of [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/The Werewolf's Spine\|The Werewolf's Spine]] mountains in the West to [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Eversun\|Eversun]] in the East, with [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/Wolfwillow Forest\|Wolfwillow Forest]] and [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/Moss Grove\|Moss Grove]] cradling the South. [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/Hunter's Trail\|Hunter's Trail]] leads out of Eversun and through the Dawn River Woodlands, leading to many of the larger settlements.

[[Sunol/Central Sunol/The Dawn River\|The Dawn River]] is a key part of this landscape, running down from the peaks of [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/The Werewolf's Spine\|The Werewolf's Spine]] and spreading out across the wood and farmlands of this area, creating rich soil that allows for the many farms that send food out to most of expanse of [[Sunol/Sunol\|Sunol]].

Many small towns make up this area of land, mostly farmlands either tended by one family or a town working together to service a larger stretch of land. [[Beiria/The Gods/The Mother\|The Mother]] is the primary deity of these lands, being the Goddess of crops and fertility, though many farmers worship all of [[Beiria/The Gods/The Ten\|The Ten]] or each of the Gods as the need arises.

###### Oakfield
Population of ~2200
Oakfield and the associated Oakfield farms are the largest farms in [[Sunol/Sunol\|Sunol]], with food from this town alone reaching most of the continent. They produce a wide variety of foods, with many families rotating crops by way of each family being responsible for one crop, and changing the land they sow each year. One of the largest (and more isolationist) farms in the area is run by a wealthy farming family, the [[Entities/Brumont Vineyard\|Brumonts]], who specialise in grapes and fine wines that are prized across the continent.
