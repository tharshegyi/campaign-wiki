The Misty Isles are a mostly secluded set of islands to the South of continental [[Sunol/Sunol\|Sunol]], at the edge of the [[Sunol/Sunol#Oceans of Sunol\|Misty Sea]]. Some combination of the winds, seas, and elevation cause these islands to be blanketed in an almost perpetual cover of fog, along with the rest of the southern sea, leading to their collective name.

The native inhabitants of the isles are the Tortles, that have their own name for each of the four main islands. Population numbers of tortles are relatively low, both on continental [[Sunol/Sunol\|Sunol]] and in the isles, leaving a lot of unclaimed and untamed parts of these islands.

Given the nearest shores of continental [[Sunol/Sunol\|Sunol]] are those of wild lands uninhabited by the common [[Sunol/Races\|races]], it can be difficult to get to these islands, and given the perpetual fog, it can be even harder to patrol. Due to this, the isles are an attractive spot for people, and boats, that don't wish to be found.
