Hunter's Trail is the main road leading from [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Eversun\|Eversun]] into the [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/Dawn River Woodlands\|Dawn River Woodlands]] and up to the edge of [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/The Werewolf's Spine\|The Werewolf's Spine]]. 

This trail is approximately 350 miles long, and takes about two weeks to traverse on horseback. It travels through many small towns in [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/Moss Grove\|Moss Grove]] and the [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/Dawn River Woodlands\|Dawn River Woodlands]].

Originally formed by hunters travelling out into the [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/Dawn River Woodlands\|Dawn River Woodlands]] and [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/The Werewolf's Spine\|The Werewolf's Spine]] for game, it became an established path when many farms started popping up in the rich soil of the [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/Dawn River Woodlands\|woodlands]], and eventually became an official road maintained by [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Eversun\|Eversun]] and the [[Characters/The Court/King William Ambrose\|crown]].
