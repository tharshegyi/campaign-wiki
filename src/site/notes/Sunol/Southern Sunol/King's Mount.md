The King's Mount is the name of the collection of mountains on the eastern side of [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/Southern Sunol\|Southern Sunol]], on which the [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/Sunspire\|Sunspire]] sits. At the base of King's Mount is [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/Annette's Rest\|Annette's Rest]] and [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/The Kingswood\|The Kingswood]], all of which were named for their founding by the early Kings of [[Characters/The Court/King William Ambrose\|Ambrose]].

It is a relatively low mountain range compared to the others on the continent, but allows for [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/Sunspire\|Sunspire]] to sit regal atop and look down over [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/The Kingswood\|The Kingswood]] and [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/The Witches Woods\|The Witches Woods]], and see as far as [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Eversun\|Eversun]] faintly in the distance.
###### The Builder's Obelisk
A large monument is carved into the side of King's Mount along [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/Hallam's Climb\|Hallam's Climb]], where a larger than life statue of Hallam himself is marked in the stone. He stands almost 200 feet tall alongside the path up the mountain, welcoming traveller's to his home and watching over them along the long road.
