Wolfwillow forest spans the southwestern corner of continental [[Sunol/Sunol\|Sunol]], from the base of [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/The Werewolf's Spine\|The Werewolf's Spine]] on the southern end to the coast overlooking [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/The Misty Isles\|The Misty Isles]]. It is a dense and lively forest, fed directly by [[Sunol/Central Sunol/The Dawn River\|The Dawn River]].

This forest is widely used for hunting by the farms of the [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/Dawn River Woodlands\|Dawn River Woodlands]], to feed the many farmers working in the rich soils to the north, and to sell the meat along with their farmed goods.

There is a population of Centaurs living in the Wolfwillow Forest, who keep mostly to themselves and do little in the way of trade or living with the common [[Sunol/Races\|races]]. When met, they claim that the homes and towns of the common folk simply are 'not made for them'. Otherwise, relations with the centaurs are good, and they are known to occasionally join in on hunts with friendly humans who live near the edge of the forest.
