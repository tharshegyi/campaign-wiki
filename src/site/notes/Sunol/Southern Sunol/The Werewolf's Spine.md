The Werewolf's Spine is the name of the mountain range that covers almost the entire western coast of [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Central Sunol\|Central]] and [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/Southern Sunol\|Southern Sunol]].

It raises from the [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Ruin Hills\|Ruin Hills]] and [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/Dawn River Woodlands\|Dawn River Woodlands]] into jagged peaks that loosely resemble a spine, giving the range its name. These mountains then drop harshly off into steep cliffs that make up the western coast of [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Central Sunol\|Central]] and [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/Southern Sunol\|Southern Sunol]].

A small path down the cliffs to a secluded beach exists on this western coast in [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/Dusk Bay\|Dusk Bay]], which is know to be used by pirates and other undesirables as a landing point in on the otherwise nearly impenetrable coast.
