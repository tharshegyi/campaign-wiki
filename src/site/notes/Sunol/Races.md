There are many races across [[Sunol/Sunol\|Sunol]]. Some are much more common than others, but almost every race imaginable is able to be found somewhere on the continent.
###### Humans 
Humans are widely spread throughout the continent, making up the majority of the population in [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Central Sunol\|Central]] and [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/Southern Sunol\|Southern Sunol]], with some migrant populations living in the [[Sunol/The Red Basin/Red Basin\|Red Basin]] to the North. Humans are considered industrious, inventors, jacks of all trades, and are found working in most every field.
###### Dwarves
Dwarves are native to the North, around the [[Sunol/The Red Basin/Red Basin\|Red Basin]], and make up a large proportion of the inhabitants of [[Sunol/The Red Basin/Vein's End\|Vein's End]]. Dwarves also considered industrious, and have a strong blue collar mining culture. Dwarves of any gender are found working more ‘manly’ trades traditionally.
###### Tieflings
Tieflings are also native to the [[Sunol/The Red Basin/Red Basin\|Red Basin]], with many of the settlements within the desert having relatively high populations of tieflings compared to other parts of the continent. Some racism exists towards this group, and many young tieflings choose to move out to the desert where others with the same traits are more common. However, it is not uncommon to see a few tieflings still living in the cities and towns of [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Central Sunol\|Central Sunol]], and while they face some discrimination, most of them get along just fine.
###### Eladren
The High Elves (Eladren) often live in the larger cities below the [[Sunol/Central Sunol/The Sky Gates\|The Sky Gates]] such as [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Brightstone\|Brightstone]] and [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Eversun\|Eversun]]. They are an old race, older than the continent, that has been living here a long time and integrated with the Humans and Dwarves that originally settled here. Eladren are considered often somewhat haughty and standoffish, and tend to be better at spellwork than other races. They often find employment in fields of knowledge and magic.
###### The Small Races
The 'small races' (Gnomes, Halflings, and Wood Elves) primarily live in smaller townships around the [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Ruin Hills\|Ruin Hills]] and [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Raven Plains\|Raven Plains]]. Many of the smaller races are considered fine craftsmen, such as the Gnomes who traditionally live in teardrop bauble huts hanging from trees. These small towns are often populated by tradespeople and travelling merchants.
###### Other Races
Other, less common native races include the Aarakokra from [[Sunol/Central Sunol/The Sky Gates\|The Sky Gates]], Centaurs out of the [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/Wolfwillow Forest\|Wolfwillow Forest]], Firbogs in [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/The Witches Woods\|The Witches Woods]], and Tortles from [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/The Misty Isles\|The Misty Isles]].
###### Migrants
There are a few other races that live in Sunol, though generally in smaller numbers and primarly as migrants from other continents such like [[Beiria/Sukrea/Sukrea\|Sukrea]]. Many of the migrants find a place for themselves in the [[Sunol/The Red Basin/Red Basin\|Red Basin]], where land is freely given to any that can make a space for themselves in the harsh desert.
