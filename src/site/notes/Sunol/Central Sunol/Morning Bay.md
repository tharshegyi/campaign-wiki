The Morning Bay is the largest bay in [[Sunol/Sunol\|Sunol]], on which the largest city, [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Eversun\|Eversun]], was founded.

It is the intersection of [[Sunol/Central Sunol/The Dawn River\|The Dawn River]] and the [[Sunol/Sunol#Oceans of Sunol\|Great Sea]], the large sea on the Eastern side of [[Sunol/Sunol\|Sunol]], leading out to [[Beiria/Sukrea/Sukrea\|Sukrea]] and other continents.

This bay holds the largest port on the continent, and as such houses a large number of ships at any one time. The many ships of the [[Entities/Allathrir Fleets\|Allathrir Fleets]] make up a large proportion of these ships.
