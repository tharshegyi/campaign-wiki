The central market in the [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Brightstone#North Yard\|North Yard]] in [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Brightstone\|Brightstone]].

The Stone Market is quite a large market, mostly run by the families of mine and desert workers. These families make supplemental coin selling produce grown in the gardens across [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Brightstone\|Brightstone]], and wares brought home by their loved ones working in the [[Sunol/The Red Basin/Red Basin\|Red Basin]]. This lends to the eclectic mix of [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Brightstone\|Brightstone]] fineries, hand-spun goods, and rare desert treasures found in the market.
