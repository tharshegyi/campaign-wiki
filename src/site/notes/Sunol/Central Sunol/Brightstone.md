Built at the base of two tall mountains, encroaching on the valley in between, this town stands as the entry to a long mountain path dubbed [[Sunol/Central Sunol/The Gateway\|The Gateway]], heading north to the [[Sunol/The Red Basin/Red Basin\|Red Basin]], where the path becomes [[Sunol/The Red Basin/The Blazing Steps\|The Blazing Steps]] in the desert beyond. The city of Brightstone then extends south into the [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Ruin Hills\|Ruin Hills]]. It is home to some 85,000 people.

The gemstones mined in the north come first down [[Sunol/The Red Basin/The Blazing Steps\|The Blazing Steps]], through [[Sunol/Central Sunol/The Gateway\|The Gateway]], and into Brightstone, which gives the city its name. Art and music thrive in this city, as gemstone-encrusted merchants pay handsomely to be entertained while living and travelling through here. Most gemstone merchants live in this city for the majority of the year, to allow them to travel north to the [[Sunol/The Red Basin/Red Basin\|Red Basin]] and [[Sunol/The Red Basin/Vein's End\|Vein's End]] and assess their mines, while living in luxury in their main homes in Brightstone.

The southern entrance serves as the connection point of three roads, east to the coast and Driftwood Bay, west to small towns the [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Ruin Hills\|Ruin Hills]], and directly south down [[Sunol/Central Sunol/The Trade Way\|The Trade Way]] to the port city of [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Eversun\|Eversun]].

Brightstone is primarily governed by a council of merchant lords, the [[Characters/Skyreach Council/Skyreach Council\|Skyreach Council]], though they answer ultimately to the [[Characters/The Court/King William Ambrose\|King]].

###### Seraphis Scroll
Seraphis Scroll is a monument to the ancient wizard Seraphis in the centre of the city, in the gardens of the [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Aetherium Institute\|Aetherium Institute]] in [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Brightstone#University Park\|University Park]]. It is a massive stone tablet adorned with the great wizard Seraphis' teachings, a monument that preserves the spells that redefined arcane education in the [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Aetherium Institute\|Aetherium Institute]] and all of [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Brightstone\|Brightstone]]. It is a common ritual for [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Aetherium Institute\|Institute]] students to touch Seraphis Scroll before big exams, to embody his knowledge and power and give them luck for a good mark.
##### Districts:
###### The Gateway 
[[Sunol/Central Sunol/The Gateway\|The Gateway]] is the valley running between the mountainous walls of [[Sunol/Central Sunol/The Sky Gates\|The Sky Gates]], and this district at the base of it goes by the same name. The pathway runs from the southern end of [[Sunol/The Red Basin/The Blazing Steps\|The Blazing Steps]], where the desert of the [[Sunol/The Red Basin/Red Basin\|Red Basin]] meets the mountains to the gates of Brightstone at the southern end. Year round market stalls are set up near the city gates in [[Sunol/Central Sunol/The Gateway\|The Gateway]] District, where poor merchants unable to afford a stand in the city set up to sell wares they've collected, crafted, and scavenged from the [[Sunol/The Red Basin/Red Basin\|Red Basin]]. A moderate population of people live here, just outside the walls, in makeshift slums.
###### North Yard 
The North Yard district host a sprawling collection of low to medium income housing, mostly inhabited by people who work in and around the mines of [[Sunol/The Red Basin/The Darlan Slopes\|The Darlan Slopes]] and [[Sunol/The Red Basin/Vein's End\|Vein's End]], but live in the city for part of the year. It is not uncommon for higher ranking workers to leave their families to live in the city and work in the [[Sunol/The Red Basin/Red Basin\|Red Basin]] desert. It also is the home of the [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Stone Market\|Stone Market]], a large market mostly run by the families of mine and desert workers.
###### Glass Forge 
The Glass Forge is a middle income housing and industrial/trades area, filled with the homes of workers and worksites such as tanneries and forges. Both housing and work facilities are cheaper around the edge, and more expensive as you get nearer [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Brightstone#University Park\|University Park]].
###### Downwood Gate
Downwood Gate is a low income housing area for people who do more menial jobs in and around Brightstone. This district pushes directly against the walls of Brightstone around the gate, and spills out in makeshift slums outside of the city proper.
###### Trade Gate 
The Trade Gate district, where [[Sunol/Central Sunol/The Trade Way\|The Trade Way]] enters Brightstone directly, holds medium income housing, mostly for people who run the trade routes for fair money. Most of the people working for [[Characters/Skyreach Council/Loris Everguard\|The Tradeguard]], a company specialising in protection for caravans travelling along [[Sunol/Central Sunol/The Trade Way\|The Trade Way]] live in this area, and the headquarters stands on the edge of the Trade Gate and [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Brightstone#University Park\|University Park]].
###### Rose Gate 
The Rose Gate district of Brightstone is made up of medium to high income housing, mainly housing the merchants of higher rank and income. At the edge of the Rose Gate district and [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Brightstone#University Park\|University Park]] sits the [[Guilds/Frost Song Adventurers Guild\|Frost Song Adventurers Guild]], the premiere adventuring guild for aspiring mages and Aetherium Institute graduates.
###### University Park 
Central to Brightstone is University Park and the [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Aetherium Institute\|Aetherium Institute]], the biggest university on the continent on [[Sunol/Sunol\|Sunol]]. Students at this university study primarily magic and archeology out of the [[Sunol/The Red Basin/Red Basin\|Red Basin]] and [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Ruin Hills\|Ruin Hills]], along with arts and literature. The district surrounding the [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Aetherium Institute\|Aetherium Institute]] is home to many of the greatest mages on the continent, as well as student accomodations and magical shops of all kinds.

University Park also boasts a large theatre, where the wealthy and noble of Brightstone and around come to watch dances and plays throughout the year. A special performance is held each day on [[Holidays and Festivals/Ladiesday\|Ladiesday]], where citizens of Brighstone can come to the theatre for free to watch a rotation of performers.
###### Skyhill 
The most affluent buildings in all of Brightstone sits upon Skyhill, a part of the city that is literally and metaphorically above the rest. Atop a ledge into the side of the mountain sits the homes of all of the [[Characters/Skyreach Council/Skyreach Council\|Skyreach Council]] Merchant Lords, the head of operations of may of their businesses, and their council chambers. Only the richest and most affluent families and businesses run out of Skyhill, and guards post at the roads that enter to stop those who do not 'belong'.
