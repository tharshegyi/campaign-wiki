A long mountain path through the peaks of [[Sunol/Central Sunol/The Sky Gates\|The Sky Gates]], The Gateway is both a district of [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Brightstone\|Brightstone]] and an entity unto itself. While near the gates entering [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Brightstone\|Brightstone]] it holds a small ramshackle town of hand-built housing and market stalls, The Gateway itself is almost 100 miles long and can take up to a week to traverse on foot from the gates of [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Brightstone\|Brightstone]] to the edge of the [[Sunol/The Red Basin/Red Basin\|Red Basin]].

Policing in the expansive [[Sunol/The Red Basin/Red Basin\|Red Basin]] is minimal, and as such, travellers are urged to exercise caution when traversing The Gateway.
