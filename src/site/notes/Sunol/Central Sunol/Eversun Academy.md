The university in [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Eversun\|Eversun]] is focused on science, magic, and healing arts, drawing from the strong tradition of restorative magics out of [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/Annette's Rest\|Annette's Rest]] and [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/The Witches Woods\|The Witches Woods]] below in [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/Southern Sunol\|Southern Sunol]].

The main schools of magic classes available at the Eversun Academy are:
 - Conjuration - Magic that transports objects, creates creatures, or brings items from other planes (e.g., _Misty Step, Find Familiar, Summon Fey_).
 - Divination - Spells that reveal information, uncover secrets, foresee the future, or locate objects (e.g., _Identify, Scrying, Detect Magic_).
 - Evokation - Manipulates energy to create explosive, elemental, or healing effects (e.g., _Fireball, Magic Missile, Cure Wounds_).

Along with the magical science of Artifice - Magic that is treated as an extension of science and physical creation, for the purpose of creating and manipulating magical items (e.g., *Infusions, Creations*)

There is also a renowned alchemical program at Eversun Academy, that works closely with the witches of [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/Annette's Rest\|Annette's Rest]] to expand the understanding of herbal healing and make it available more broadly. They host a yearly excursion of medical students to [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/Annette's Rest\|Annette's Rest]] during the [[Holidays and Festivals/Autumn Equinox\|Autumn Equinox]], to gather medicinal supplies from [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/The Witches Woods\|The Witches Woods]]. The Academy has strong historical ties to the [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/Sunspire\|Sunspire]] and ancient lands of [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/Southern Sunol\|Southern Sunol]], and boasts quite a well respected history program.
