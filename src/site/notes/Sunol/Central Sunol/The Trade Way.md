The Trade Way is the main road through [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Central Sunol\|Central Sunol]], spanning the entire [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Raven Plains\|Raven Plains]] and connecting [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Brightstone\|Brightstone]] and [[Sunol/Central Sunol/The Sky Gates\|The Sky Gates]] to the North to [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Eversun\|Eversun]] and the paths south. There are a number of towns and settlements along and off small paths intersecting The Trade Way, many of which are too small to show on maps.

The Trade Way as the crow flies is approximately 525 miles long, and takes about three weeks to travel on horseback. Longer, if travelling with a large caravan, as is often done, up to two months.

Travel along the trade way is often undertaken with the help of [[Entities/The Tradeguard\|The Tradeguard]], which organises caravans and guards for the long journey between the two main cities.
###### The Ashen Watchtower
The Ashen Watchtower is a landmark along The Trade Way, about 1/3rd of the way from [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Eversun\|Eversun]] to [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Brightstone\|Brightstone]]. It is what remains of an old lookout for a nearby ruined castle, a tall spired watchtower that overlooks the long road and out to the [[Sunol/Sunol#Oceans of Sunol\|Great Sea]]. It stands at over 100 feet tall, and can be seen from almost 20 miles away.

This watchtower was badly damaged in the second Battle of the [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Raven Plains\|Plains]] in the [[Beiria/War of the Great Sea\|War of the Great Sea]], the furthest inland that the [[Beiria/Sukrea/Kingdom of Zaradorn\|Kingdom of Zaradorn]] managed to reach on continental [[Sunol/Sunol\|Sunol]]. This tower now stands as a monument to those who fought in the land war against the [[Beiria/Sukrea/Kingdom of Zaradorn\|Kingdom of Zaradorn]].
