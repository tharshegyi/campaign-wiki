The Dawn River is a large river running down from the heights of [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/The Werewolf's Spine\|The Werewolf's Spine]] running along the Western coast of [[Sunol/Sunol\|Sunol]], down through the aptly named [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/Dawn River Woodlands\|Dawn River Woodlands]], and through the centre of [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Eversun\|Eversun]]. 

This river feeds the many farms in the [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/Dawn River Woodlands\|woodlands]], built upon the richest soil in Sunol provided by the river, and eventually runs into the [[Sunol/Sunol#Oceans of Sunol\|Great Sea]] via the Morning Bay.
