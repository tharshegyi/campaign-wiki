The Ruin Hills is large area filled with rolling hills, and a setting for many small settlements. It marks the edge of the harsher peaks of [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/The Werewolf's Spine\|The Werewolf's Spine]] mountains to the West, and the more flattened terrain of the [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Raven Plains\|Raven Plains]] to the East. The area has many ruins across it, which lend the area its name, and is much more [[Beiria/The Gods/The Ten\|religious]] than other regions around [[Sunol/Sunol\|Sunol]].

Like the [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Raven Plains\|Raven Plains]], most people in the Ruin Hills live in pockets of small towns spread across the area. Some small towns of note include:
###### Arden 
Population of ~1800
The largest settlement on the Western side of [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Central Sunol\|Central Sunol]], this town sits atop a hill. The village is built around the ancient ruins of a temple, and as such attracts a large number of highly religious residents and pilgrims. It is governed by a mayor, a male [[Sunol/Races#The Small Races\|halfling]] named [[Characters/Brida Harbotle\|Brida Harbotle]]. Arden is a common stop for adventurers and travellers that service the central Sunol areas.

###### Ashmount
Population of ~1400
This town exists near the edge of [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/The Werewolf's Spine\|The Werewolf's Spine]] at the southern end of the Ruin Hills, and is known for producing more soldiers per capita than any other place in [[Sunol/Sunol\|Sunol]]. Filled primarily with aspiring and active soldiers and veterans, the worship [[Beiria/The Gods/The Soldier\|The Soldier]] is almost a given in this town. Many young men and women who strive to protect [[Sunol/Sunol\|Sunol]] and the [[Characters/The Court/King William Ambrose\|crown]] come to Ashmount to begin training until they reach such an age that they may enlist in the [[Characters/The Court/King William Ambrose\|King]]'s army. Soldiers trained at The Training Grounds in Ashmount are highly respected and share a camaraderie, and tend to reach an officer status faster than those without.
