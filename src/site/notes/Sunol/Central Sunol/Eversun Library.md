Eversun Library is the largest in [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/Southern Sunol\|Southern Sunol]] and [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Central Sunol\|Central Sunol]] all the way up to [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Brightstone\|Brightstone]].

Much like the [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Eversun Academy\|Eversun Academy]], the Eversun Library offers an array of books and information on the nature of magic, the study of science, and the history of [[Sunol/Sunol\|Sunol]].

Eversun Library employs a large number of librarians, and even a number of mages that fill the halls and can offer advise on magical questions to students and private individuals alike. 

Unlike the libraries at the [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Aetherium Institute\|Aetherium Institute]] and the [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Eversun Academy\|Eversun Academy]], this library is open to the public without the need to acquire special permissions for entry. It does, however, have quite a strict dress code.
