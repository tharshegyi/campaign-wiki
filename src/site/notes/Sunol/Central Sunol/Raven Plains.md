The Raven Plains are a large expanse of relatively flat landscape that encompass the eastern side of [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Central Sunol\|Central Sunol]]. It is home to a large variety of wildlife that can make it somewhat treacherous to traverse off the main roads.

The primary landmark of the Raven Plains is [[Sunol/Central Sunol/The Trade Way\|The Trade Way]] snaking through its entirety. This path is marked with many small towns, almost too many to name.
