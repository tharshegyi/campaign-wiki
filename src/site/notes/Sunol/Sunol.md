Sunol is a continent (and collection of islands called [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/The Misty Isles\|The Misty Isles]]) on the planet [[Beiria/Beiria\|Beiria]].

Sunol was settled about 1600 years ago by both [[Sunol/Races#Dwarves\|Dwarves]] and [[Sunol/Races#Humans\|Humans]] separately - though they argue to this day over who was first. [[Sunol/Races#Eladren\|Eladren]] also like to claim that they had been visiting the continent for a long time before the settlement, but did not begin to build on the land before the [[Sunol/Races#Dwarves\|Dwarves]] and [[Sunol/Races#Humans\|Humans]] had already broken ground. There are [[Sunol/Races#Other Races\|some races]] that seem to be native only to certain parts of Sunol, such as Aarakokra from [[Sunol/Central Sunol/The Sky Gates\|The Sky Gates]], Centaurs out of the [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/Wolfwillow Forest\|Wolfwillow Forest]], Firbogs in [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/The Witches Woods\|The Witches Woods]], and Tortles from [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/The Misty Isles\|The Misty Isles]].

The common [[Sunol/Races\|races]] of Sunol include [[Sunol/Races#Humans\|humans]], [[Sunol/Races#Dwarves\|dwarves]], [[Sunol/Races#Eladren\|eladren]], and [[Sunol/Races#Tieflings\|tieflings]]. Other populations also exist on the continent, such as the [[Sunol/Races#The Small Races\|wood elves, gnomes, halflings]], [[Sunol/Races#Other Races\|aarakokra, centaurs, firbogs, and tortles]]. 
###### Geography
The continent of Sunol sits below [[Beiria/Beiria\|Beiria]]'s equator, south east of the central continental dictatorship [[Beiria/Sukrea/Sukrea\|Sukrea]]. It has four [[Sunol/Sunol#Oceans of Sunol\|oceans]], surrounding it on all sides and surrounding the extracontinental islands of [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/The Misty Isles\|The Misty Isles]].

The western coast of Sunol is dominated by a large mountain range called [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/The Werewolf's Spine\|The Werewolf's Spine]], which drops off in sheer cliffs into the Green Sea. The eastern side of Sunol is much lower elevation and has many more beaches and ports, such as [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Morning Bay\|Morning Bay]], the main trading port of the continent.

Continental Sunol is commonly split into three parts: The [[Sunol/The Red Basin/Red Basin\|Red Basin]], [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Central Sunol\|Central Sunol]], and [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/Southern Sunol\|Southern Sunol]]. The [[Sunol/The Red Basin/Red Basin\|Red Basin]] is the northern desert area, between two mountain ranges ([[Sunol/The Red Basin/The Darlan Slopes\|The Darlan Slopes]] and [[Sunol/Central Sunol/The Sky Gates\|The Sky Gates]]). [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Central Sunol\|Central Sunol]] is the largest region, making up the entire central area of the continent and containing the two main cities of Sunol, [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Eversun\|Eversun]], the capital and trading hub, and [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Brightstone\|Brightstone]], the second largest city in both size and revenue. And finally [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/Southern Sunol\|Southern Sunol]], a more wild forest and mountain area, home to more uncommon and isolated [[Sunol/Races\|Races]], as well as some human settlements and the centre of farming for the continent.

###### Economy
The continent of Sunol is self sufficient, but trades in gemstones and other goods with other continents and islands. The main trades made by Sunol are with the Kingdom of Zaradorn, on the western coast of [[Beiria/Sukrea/Sukrea\|Sukrea]], despite political differences. Trade with inland kingdoms of [[Beiria/Sukrea/Sukrea\|Sukrea]] is quite difficult considering the expanse of Zaradorn. Sunol also does some trade with other smaller societies nearby.

[[Sunol/Sunolusite\|Sunolusite]] is the main export for the continent, a gemstone that produces heat and sells very well to colder climates. The mining expertise needed to produce the [[Sunol/Sunolusite\|Sunolusite]] exported also applies to other gemstones and stone goods, which are exported across the oceans as well.
###### Government
Most of the ruling for continental Sunol is done by [[Sunol/The Royal Court\|The Royal Court]], out of the [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Eversun#Ambrose Keep\|Ambrose Keep]] in [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Eversun\|Eversun]], on behalf of the royal family of Ambrose; The [[Characters/The Court/King William Ambrose\|King William Ambrose]], the (Late) [[Characters/The Court/Queen Seraphina Ambrose\|Queen Seraphina Ambrose]], [[Characters/The Court/Prince Allon Ambrose\|Prince Allon Ambrose]], and [[Characters/The Court/Princess Alayna Ambrose\|Princess Alayna Ambrose]].

More local decisions are often made by elected officials for towns and cities. Notably, the city of [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Brightstone\|Brightstone]] is lead by a a council of merchant lords, [[Characters/Skyreach Council/Skyreach Council\|Skyreach Council]], and [[Sunol/The Red Basin/Vein's End\|Vein's End]], in the far north, is famously ungoverned.

###### Travel
The length of the roads spanning from [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/Sunspire\|Sunspire]] in [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/Southern Sunol\|Southern Sunol]] to [[Sunol/The Red Basin/Vein's End\|Vein's End]] in the [[Sunol/The Red Basin/Red Basin\|Red Basin]] is approximately 2300 miles, which would take approximately 14 weeks to travel by horseback as the crow flies (travelling an average of 25 miles/day).

Specific and frequently used paths include:
[[Sunol/The Red Basin/The Blazing Steps\|The Blazing Steps]] is a winding and treacherous path, about 440 miles long, and would take almost three weeks to travel at a normal pace on horseback. With the nature of the [[Sunol/The Red Basin/Red Basin\|Red Basin]] desert, it more often takes four to five weeks, and can take months to traverse with a caravan.
[[Sunol/Central Sunol/The Trade Way\|The Trade Way]] is approximately 525 miles long, and takes about three weeks to travel on horseback. Longer, if travelling with a large caravan, as is often done, up to two months.
[[Sunol/Southern Sunol/Hunter's Trail\|Hunter's Trail]] is approximately 350 miles long, and takes about two weeks to traverse on horseback
[[Sunol/Southern Sunol/Hallam's Climb\|Hallam's Climb]] is about 775 miles long through [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/The Kingswood\|The Kingswood]], and would take approximately 4.5 weeks to travel on horseback, up to twice as long on foot.
