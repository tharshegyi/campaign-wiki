Sunolusite is gemstone main export of [[Sunol/Sunol\|Sunol]]. It is hotly debated weather the name of the continent or the gemstone came first.

It is an amber coloured and mostly transparent gemstone, that seems to flicker lightly like fire when it catches the light. Sunolusite is unique in that it produces a small amount of heat. Large underground deposits of this gemstone are theorised to have resulted in the desert forming in the [[Sunol/The Red Basin/Red Basin\|Red Basin]], and veins seen running through [[Sunol/The Red Basin/The Darlan Slopes\|The Darlan Slopes]] seem to keep ice off the mountains peaks.

This gemstone sells very well to colder continents such as [[Beiria/Sukrea/Sukrea\|Sukrea]], as well as the colder areas in [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/Southern Sunol\|Southern Sunol]], where it can be kept in the pockets of the wealthy as perpetual handwarmers. The super wealthy sometimes use piles of sunolusite in lieu of fires as they require no tending and create no smell.
