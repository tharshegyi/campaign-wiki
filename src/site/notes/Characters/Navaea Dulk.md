Navaea Dulk is the matriarch of the town of [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Raven Plains#Dulkharth\|Dulkhearth]], central to [[Sunol/Central Sunol/The Trade Way\|The Trade Way]] in the [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Raven Plains\|Raven Plains]].

Navaea is usually dressed in dark, embroidered religious robes. She has ivory skin, golden almond-shaped eyes, and short, straight silver hair. She looks relatively young for a part-[[Sunol/Races#Eladren\|elf]], and quite short.

She is a devout follower of [[Beiria/The Gods/The Stranger\|The Stranger]], like her family before her. The Dulk's have been heads of Dulkhearth for generations since its founding. The family built their large home out of the old ruins of a temple, and buried the first matriarch Myantha Dulk, in the plot behind that became the towns cemetery. That cemetery now acts as a resting place for people from around the [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Raven Plains\|Raven Plains]], and the original Dulk Manor now acts as a temple and training theatre for followers of [[Beiria/The Gods/The Stranger\|The Stranger]].
