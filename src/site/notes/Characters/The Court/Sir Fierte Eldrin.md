A member of [[Sunol/The Royal Court\|The Royal Court]] that rules out of [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Eversun\|Eversun]], in the [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Eversun#Court District\|Court District]].

Hand of the King Sir Fierte Eldrin is the Kings main advisor, sort of prime minister, supervising all the rest of the council and acting as the [[Characters/The Court/King William Ambrose\|King William Ambrose]]'s “number 2”.

Fierte wears very extravagant clothes, with a fine and unblemished traveling cloak. He is a [[Sunol/Races#Humans\|human]] with tan skin, hazel eyes and medium-length wavy blond, almost white hair. He is medium height, skinny, and is always sniffling and sneezing. He looks surprisingly average, for the right hand of The King.

Sir Eldren is serenely even-tempered and well-adjusted. He believes you can never have too much money and believes it is important to achieve recognition. He believes being correct is more important than having an open mind.
