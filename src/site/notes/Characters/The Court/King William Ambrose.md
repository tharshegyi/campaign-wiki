A member of [[Sunol/The Royal Court\|The Royal Court]] that rules out of [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Eversun\|Eversun]], in the [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Eversun#Court District\|Court District]].

The King William Ambrose’s clothing is the height of extravagance - the finest silks, furs, and jewellery. He is an older [[Sunol/Races#Humans\|human]] man, with tan skin and blue eyes, gray hair is cropped short, and is generally freshly shaved. He is tall and somewhat round, making him a rather large man in all aspects. 

He has trouble keeping things in perspective - often making mountains out of molehills. He believes it is important to achieve your goals and he just does what feels good. He believes natural resources should be exploited rather than preserved.

The King is not particularly well liked. He spends most of his days enjoying fineries - wine, food, his fleet of court dancers - and little time actually governing the realm. Most of the actual governing is done by [[Sunol/The Royal Court\|The Royal Court]] and The [[Characters/Skyreach Council/Skyreach Council\|Skyreach Council]]. While he has never actually done anything particularly bad for the realm, he has not done much good for it either. Not since his late wife, [[Characters/The Court/Queen Seraphina Ambrose\|Queen Seraphina Ambrose]], became ill and quickly passed several years before.
