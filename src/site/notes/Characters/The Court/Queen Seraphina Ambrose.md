A member of [[Sunol/The Royal Court\|The Royal Court]] that rules out of [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Eversun\|Eversun]], in the [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Eversun#Court District\|Court District]].

The Queen Seraphina had flawless pale skin and golden almond-shaped eyes. She had long wavy copper hair that she would keep in a braid down her back. A full [[Sunol/Races#Eladren\|Eladren]], she was tall and thin, and incredibly beautiful.

The Queen was known for being kind and charitable, if a bit vain. She fancied nothing more than throwing elaborate charitable balls, which both gave her a chance to show off her extensive collection of fine gowns and jewellery, and allowed her to give back to the community.

Queen Seraphina Ambrose died several years ago after a short and severe illness. Since her death, her widowed husband [[Characters/The Court/King William Ambrose\|King William Ambrose]] has done little to carry on her legacy of charity and kindness.
