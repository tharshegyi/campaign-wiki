The Marshall, Sir Alaric Voss, is Commander of the realm’s armies and strategy.

He has dark skin, hazel eyes, and medium-length wavy gray hair. He has a gray handlebar mustache. He is broad and incredibly well built, an older man, with thick, muscled arms and a bit of a stomach. He is perceptive, but speaks very slowly. He respects his chain of command and believes it is important to achieve recognition through service and loyalty.
