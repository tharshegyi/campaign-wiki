The Provost Tanlin Sheb acts as the elected mayor of [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Eversun\|Eversun]], who handles practical business of the main city (disposing of thrash, housing, urban health, security, etc.) so that [[Characters/The Court/King William Ambrose\|The King]] doesn’t have to do it himself while also managing a whole realm.

He cares deeply for this city, it is where he grew up and studied at [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Eversun Academy\|Eversun Academy]]. He is incredibly well-read, and believes it is important to respect tradition and he appreciates the value of an ordered society. He is a devout follower of [[Beiria/The Gods/The Ten\|The Ten]].
