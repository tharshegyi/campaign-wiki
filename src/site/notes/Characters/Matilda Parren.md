Matilda Parren is the mayor of the town [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Raven Plains#Halfway Hollow\|Halfway Hollow]], central to [[Sunol/Central Sunol/The Trade Way\|The Trade Way]] in the [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Raven Plains\|Raven Plains]].

Matilda is a very serious but ultimately good woman, who makes a point to dress in fine clothing, and seems perpetually busy. She has ruddy skin and blue eyes, with long wavy dark brown and gray hair put up in braids. She is fantastically strong and fairly tall for a [[Sunol/Races#Humans\|human]] woman, around 5'9.

She has an instinctive sense of the right course of action at all times. She wants the world to be a fair place for everyone and feels good when she helps someone. She believes fun distracts you from the important things in life
