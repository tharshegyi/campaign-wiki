Thornick "Twin-Eye" Varn is the guildmaster of the [[Guilds/Twin Rats Adventurers Guild\|Twin Rats Adventurers Guild]], based in [[Sunol/The Red Basin/Vein's End#The Scrapyards\|The Scrapyards]] of [[Sunol/The Red Basin/Vein's End\|Vein's End]]. He is also an active adventurer, as the head of [[Guilds/The Sandguard\|The Sandguard]] adventuring party.

Thornick is a short but broad [[Sunol/Races#Humans\|human]] man, who wears good quality leather armour most of the time, and a fine pair of leather boots. He has pale skin and bright red hair, and has become incredibly freckled from the desert sun in the [[Sunol/The Red Basin/Red Basin\|Red Basin]]. He constantly has the beginnings of a scruffy beard he can't seek to keep on top of.

He has a close relationship with [[Characters/Guild Members/Fool's Gold/Baldus Talvion\|Baldus Talvion]] of the [[Guilds/Fool's Gold Adventurers Guild\|Fool's Gold Adventurers Guild]], having spent some time adventuring with the guild before making his own in the [[Sunol/The Red Basin/Red Basin\|Red Basin]], in an altruistic attempt to help the locals in the under-serviced area.
