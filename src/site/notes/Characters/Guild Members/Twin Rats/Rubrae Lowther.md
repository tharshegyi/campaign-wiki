Rubrae an adventurer, part of [[Guilds/The Sandguard\|The Sandguard]] adventuring party run out of the [[Guilds/Twin Rats Adventurers Guild\|Twin Rats Adventurers Guild]] in [[Sunol/The Red Basin/Vein's End\|Vein's End]].

Rubrae is a [[Sunol/Races#Other Races\|half-elf]] female cleric, who wears travel-worn priestly vestments denoting a devotion to all of [[Beiria/The Gods/The Ten\|The Ten]]. She is quite young for a cleric, and has dark brown skin, hazel almond-shaped eyes, and short, curly black hair. 

She is impeccably well-dressed and groomed at all times. She just wants everyone to get along and does wish people would be more in touch with the natural world. She believes terrible decisions are justified as long as ones intention is good.

Rubrae acts as a charitable force for the [[Guilds/Twin Rats Adventurers Guild\|Twin Rats Adventurers Guild]], and leads her party into many quests for the greater good of the [[Sunol/The Red Basin/Red Basin\|Red Basin]]. She also runs a soup kitchen for the poor of [[Sunol/The Red Basin/Vein's End\|Vein's End]] out of the [[Sunol/The Red Basin/Oasis Markets\|Oasis Markets]] bi-weekly.
