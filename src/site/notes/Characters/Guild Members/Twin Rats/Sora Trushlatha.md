Sora is an adventurer, part of [[Guilds/The Sandguard\|The Sandguard]] adventuring party run out of the [[Guilds/Twin Rats Adventurers Guild\|Twin Rats Adventurers Guild]] in [[Sunol/The Red Basin/Vein's End\|Vein's End]].

Sora is a [[Sunol/Races#Other Races\|dragonborn]] bard, who wears lavish clothing, in darker colours but with fine embellishment. She prefers silver embroidered clothing that matches her silver scales and brings out her blue eyes. She has a distinctive horn, that sticks up from the end of her snout.

She believes it is important to be daring and to stand on your own. She believes being open minded is more important than being correct. She is always up for a good time, and enjoys drinking and gambling at [[Entities/The Jester's Coin\|The Jester's Coin]] in her free time.
