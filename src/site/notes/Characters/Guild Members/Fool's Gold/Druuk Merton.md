Druuk is an adventurer, part of the [[Guilds/The Foragers\|The Foragers]] adventuring party run out of the [[Guilds/Fool's Gold Adventurers Guild\|Fool's Gold Adventurers Guild]] in [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Eversun\|Eversun]].

Druuk is a young, yet experienced, ranger, who wears well-worn traveling clothes. He has pale grey-green skin and deep-set brow eyes. His black hair is cropped short, with thick sideburns. He is quite nimble and tough, a little skinny for a [[Sunol/Races#Other Races\|half-orc]], but still muscular.

He loves to enjoy life and believes everyone should try to stand on their own. He believes political boundaries are arbitrary and irrelevant, and instead thinks that adventurers should serve the whole realm instead of their particular area. He is known to travel out to the [[Guilds/Twin Rats Adventurers Guild\|Twin Rats Adventurers Guild]] in [[Sunol/The Red Basin/Vein's End\|Vein's End]] often to assist them.
