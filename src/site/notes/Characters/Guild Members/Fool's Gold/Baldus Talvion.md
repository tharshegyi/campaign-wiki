Baldus is an excitable man, who will rave to anyone who will listen. He always tries to repair and not replace, working with old weapons and old adventurers to try and make something great again. It was this mentality that drove him into the Guild business. As a young man he became a bard and adventurer to pay off his families debts, and became quite successful, now, however he prefers the slower and less dangerous life of a guild master.

Baldus lives upstairs in the [[Guilds/Fool's Gold Adventurers Guild\|Fool's Gold]] guild hall with his wife [[Characters/Guild Members/Fool's Gold/Marigold Talvion\|Marigold]] and their cat [[Characters/Guild Members/Fool's Gold/Copper\|Copper]].
