Dac is an adventurer, part of the [[Guilds/The Foragers\|The Foragers]] adventuring party run out of the [[Guilds/Fool's Gold Adventurers Guild\|Fool's Gold Adventurers Guild]] in [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Eversun\|Eversun]].

Dac is a large, [[Sunol/Races#Other Races\|tortle]] man from [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/The Misty Isles\|The Misty Isles]], that wears simple travelling gear but carries a number of religious talismans. He is a devout follower of [[Beiria/The Gods/The Healer\|The Healer]], and holds deep respect for [[Beiria/The Gods/The Crone\|The Crone]]. He is both tall and broad, with blue-green skin, a brown shell, and bright yellow eyes.

Like other tortles, one could call Dac 'slow', however, his friends prefer to call him 'thoughtful'. While he often takes his time to respond to questions, he generally has something of substance to say, if he has something to say at all.
