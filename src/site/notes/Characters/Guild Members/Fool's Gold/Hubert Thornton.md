Hubert is an adventurer, part of the [[Guilds/Ironquill\|Ironquill]] adventuring party run out of the [[Guilds/Fool's Gold Adventurers Guild\|Fool's Gold Adventurers Guild]] in [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Eversun\|Eversun]].

Hubert Thornton is, first and foremost, incredibly tall. He is quite young, and 100% [[Sunol/Races#Humans\|human]], but over 6'6 with curly light brown hair and hazel eyes. He is clean shaven, or, perhaps, cannot grow a beard.

He is calm and even-tempered, but also somewhat dull. He has few hobbies and few words, but wields a greatsword with great skill.
