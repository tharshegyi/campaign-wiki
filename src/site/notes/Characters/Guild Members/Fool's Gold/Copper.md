Copper is the 26 year old cat of [[Characters/Guild Members/Fool's Gold/Marigold Talvion\|Marigold]] and [[Characters/Guild Members/Fool's Gold/Baldus Talvion\|Baldus Talvion]], owners of the [[Guilds/Fool's Gold Adventurers Guild\|Fool's Gold Adventurers Guild]].

Copper is incredibly crusty and it is a wonder that he is still alive.

There are rumours that Copper lives only due to dark magics.
