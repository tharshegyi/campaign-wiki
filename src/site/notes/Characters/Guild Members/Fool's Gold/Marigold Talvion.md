They founded the [[Guilds/Fool's Gold Adventurers Guild\|Fool's Gold Adventurers Guild]] with money they earned as adventurer's in their youth, and money Baldus earned playing as a respected bard in [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Eversun\|Eversun]].

[[Characters/Guild Members/Fool's Gold/Baldus Talvion\|Baldus]] named the guild 'Fool's Gold' after her. Goldie is a tall woman, standing at 6'5. She is still well built from her fighting days, and has green skin and white hair and very subtly visible lower tusks.

She has made a comfortable life for herself in her retirement, and enjoys taking a motherly role with the adventurer's in their guild. She often makes family dinners for the guild and forces the adventurer's to come together to eat together. She enjoys doing cross-stitch and making doilies and blankets that she uses to decorate the guild hall, in an effort to make the room more 'cosy' and 'welcoming'.

Goldie lives upstairs in the [[Guilds/Fool's Gold Adventurers Guild\|Fool's Gold]] guild hall with her husband [[Characters/Guild Members/Fool's Gold/Baldus Talvion\|Baldus]] and their cat [[Characters/Guild Members/Fool's Gold/Copper\|Copper]].
