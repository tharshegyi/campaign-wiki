Ermina is an adventurer, part of the [[Guilds/Ironquill\|Ironquill]] adventuring party run out of the [[Guilds/Fool's Gold Adventurers Guild\|Fool's Gold Adventurers Guild]] in [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Eversun\|Eversun]].

She is an attractive [[Sunol/Races#Humans\|human]] sorceress, lean and moderately muscular. She wears a long, grey, dusty cloak over fine robes. Her black hair is cut to her shoulders in a wolf cut, and her hazel eyes are passionate and lively.

She loves justice and goodness and right action. Anyone who does not fulfil this criteria perfectly will no doubt get a lecture from her. She is the most sanctimonious self-righteous [[Sunol/Races#Humans\|human]] in existence, and an amazing painter.
