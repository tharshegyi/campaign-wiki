Harrison is an adventurer, part of the [[Guilds/The Foragers\|The Foragers]] adventuring party run out of the [[Guilds/Fool's Gold Adventurers Guild\|Fool's Gold Adventurers Guild]] in [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Eversun\|Eversun]].

Harrison is a lively [[Sunol/Races#The Small Races\|halfling]] man, who fully lives up to the stereotypes of bards. He is of a regular size for a [[Sunol/Races#The Small Races\|halfling]], which is to say, quite small.

He has pale skin, hazel eyes, and short, curly light brown hair. He has a curly light brown moustache. Harrison likes to dress in finery, in browns and greens that match his eyes with fine embroidery. He is a bit of a snob about clothes, and boasts that he owns a piece made by [[Characters/Skyreach Council/Legend\|Legend]] herself.

Harrison is a lover of a good time. Harrison is also a lover of people - women, men, anything in between.
