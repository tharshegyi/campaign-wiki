Manfred is an adventurer, part of the [[Guilds/Ironquill\|Ironquill]] adventuring party run out of the [[Guilds/Fool's Gold Adventurers Guild\|Fool's Gold Adventurers Guild]] in [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Eversun\|Eversun]].

Manfred is a [[Sunol/Races#Humans\|human]] ranger, who wears fine but well-worn traveling clothes, and a bow and shortsword most of the time. He has pale skin, brown eyes, and short, wavy black hair. He is quick and tough, and incredibly fast with his bow.

He sometimes has a gut feeling about things, and is often correct, and as such acts as the leader of the [[Guilds/Ironquill\|Ironquill]] party. He appreciates art and beauty and enjoys being in charge, however, he believes being correct is more important than having an open mind.

Manfred is a migrant to [[Sunol/Sunol\|Sunol]], having come from a land in [[Beiria/Sukrea/Sukrea\|Sukrea]] that is now part of the [[Beiria/Sukrea/Kingdom of Zaradorn\|Kingdom of Zaradorn]] when he was a small child with his parents.
