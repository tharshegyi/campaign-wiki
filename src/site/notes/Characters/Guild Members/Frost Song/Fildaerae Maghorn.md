Fildaerae Maghorn is the head mage and guildmaster of the [[Guilds/Frost Song Adventurers Guild\|Frost Song Adventurers Guild]], based out of the [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Brightstone#Rose gate\|Rose Gate]] district of [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Brightstone\|Brightstone]].

Fildaerae is an older [[Sunol/Races#Eladren\|Eladren]] wizard, who is often seen wearing good-quality robes, carrying a number of books and parchments, with a pair of spectacles hanging from a chain around her neck. 

She has pale skin and golden almond-shaped eyes, and is quite tall and lithe. Her straight black hair is always tied in a long braid that she then piles atop her head in an intricate hairdo. Her sleeves are often rolled up to show off her arms, which are commonly ink-stained from notetaking.

She is possessed of an uncommonly keen intellect. She believes it is important to excel at something, and she believes the tried and true traditional way is best.
