Blendaeth 'Blen' Tiammanthyllish is an adventurer, part of the [[Guilds/The Inkwell Society\|The Inkwell Society]] adventuring party run out of the [[Guilds/Frost Song Adventurers Guild\|Frost Song Adventurers Guild]] in [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Brightstone\|Brightstone]].

Blen wears fine shining armour that almost seems to glow with holy light, and is stamped with the book symbol of [[Beiria/The Gods/The Scholar\|The Scholar]]. She is a [[Sunol/Races#Other Races\|dragonborn]], with dull copper scales, bronze eyes, and large finned ears that stick out from the sides of her head.

Blen stands almost a full head above the other adventurers in her party, and almost twice as broad. She takes her position as the strength of the party very seriously, but is also incredibly intelligent. She graduated top of her class from the [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Aetherium Institute\|Aetherium Institute]] and was quickly recruited to [[Guilds/The Inkwell Society\|The Inkwell Society]].
