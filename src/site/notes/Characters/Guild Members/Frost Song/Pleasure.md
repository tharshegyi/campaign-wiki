Pleasure is an adventurer, part of the [[Guilds/The Inkwell Society\|The Inkwell Society]] adventuring party run out of the [[Guilds/Frost Song Adventurers Guild\|Frost Song Adventurers Guild]] in [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Brightstone\|Brightstone]].

Pleasure is a powerful [[Sunol/Races#Tieflings\|tiefling]] sorcerer, who has light skin and totally golden eyes with no visible sclera. The sides of his head are shaved, with a strip of curly blonde hair down the middle, and ram-like horns that curve out from his head.

He is fantastically charming and witty, but also has a streak of arrogance and overconfidence. He was studying at the [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Aetherium Institute\|Aetherium Institute]] when he was scouted for [[Guilds/The Inkwell Society\|The Inkwell Society]], and did not end up finishing his education, instead opting to focus his energy on adventuring, and enjoying the spoils of his adventuring.
