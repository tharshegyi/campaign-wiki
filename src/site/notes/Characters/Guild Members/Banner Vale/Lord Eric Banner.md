Guildmaster of the [[Guilds/Banner Vale Adventurers Guild\|Banner Vale Adventurers Guild]] in [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Eversun\|Eversun]]

Lord Banner is generally seen high-quality armour and a well-tailored, and notably clean, travelling cloak. He has light skin, brown eyes, and medium-length wavy light brown hair. He is a middle-aged [[Sunol/Races#Humans\|human]] man, with thick light brown beard, and is built tall and broad.

He desires fame and notoriety and believes it is important to be in charge. He is considered quite an attractive man, and is very ambitious. His greatest desire is for the [[Guilds/Banner Vale Adventurers Guild\|Banner Vale Adventurers Guild]] to become the premiere guild in all of [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Eversun\|Eversun]], if not all of [[Sunol/Sunol\|Sunol]], and he is well on his way to doing that.
