Taklinn is an adventurer, part of the [[Guilds/Dawn's Vanguard\|Dawn's Vanguard]] adventuring party run out of the [[Guilds/Banner Vale Adventurers Guild\|Banner Vale Adventurers Guild]] in [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Eversun\|Eversun]].

Taklinn wears only the highest quality armour and an air of confidence, and is known as a skilled fighter. He has light brown skin, deep-set hazel eyes, and medium-length straight red and grey hair. He has a long red and grey beard that is intricately braided with pieces of metal through it. He is incredibly muscular for his stature, even for a [[Sunol/Races#Dwarves\|dwarf]].

Taklinn is one to drink and one to gamble, and takes part in the contests of strength every year on [[Holidays and Festivals/Moonfest\|Moonfest]] and [[Holidays and Festivals/Adar's Rest\|Adar's Rest]].
