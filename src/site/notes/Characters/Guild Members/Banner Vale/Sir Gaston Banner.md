Sir Gaston Banner, much like his older brother [[Characters/Guild Members/Banner Vale/Lord Eric Banner\|Lord Eric Banner]], is generally seen high-quality armour and a well-tailored travelling cloak. He has light skin, brown eyes, and wavy light brown hair that he keeps cut short on the side and full on the top. He is a young [[Sunol/Races#Humans\|human]] man and is built tall and broad, lending to his strength as a fighter.
