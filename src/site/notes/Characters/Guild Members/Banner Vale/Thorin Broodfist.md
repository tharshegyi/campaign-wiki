Thorin Broodfist is an adventurer, part of [[Guilds/The Goldseekers\|The Goldseekers]] adventuring party run out of the [[Guilds/Banner Vale Adventurers Guild\|Banner Vale Adventurers Guild]] in [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Eversun\|Eversun]].

Thorin is a [[Sunol/Races#Dwarves\|dwarven]] monk, who mostly wears simple monastic clothing. He has light brown skin and deep-set brown eyes. He has medium-length wavy dark brown hair, with the beginnings of a bald spot coming in that is obvious to everyone but him. He has a long dark brown beard, styled in elaborate braids. His sleeves are almost always rolled up to show off his (admittedly, huge) arms.

Thorin takes himself quite seriously, and can react standoffishly when questioned if he believes he is correct about something. He is rather quiet, except when he is angered, or drinking.
