Elysande is an adventurer, part of the [[Guilds/Blood Oath\|Blood Oath]] adventuring party run out of the [[Guilds/Banner Vale Adventurers Guild\|Banner Vale Adventurers Guild]] in [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Eversun\|Eversun]].

She is a [[Sunol/Races#Humans\|human]] barbarian who has ruddy skin and brown eyes. Her very long curly blond hair is tied in a ponytail. She is slow-moving but strong, and dresses in tight leathers that show off large muscles.

She is a woman of few words, instead opting to stand with her party members, arms crossed, in silence. She tends to defer to her party leader, [[Characters/Guild Members/Banner Vale/Gerard Winchester\|Gerard Winchester]], to answer any questions for her, but that does not mean she is stupid. Instead, she seems to have a keen mind and a penchant for listening.
