Righteous is an adventurer, part of the [[Guilds/Dawn's Vanguard\|Dawn's Vanguard]] adventuring party run out of the [[Guilds/Banner Vale Adventurers Guild\|Banner Vale Adventurers Guild]] in [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Eversun\|Eversun]].

Righteous wears the finest clothing out of all in her party, with a penchant for wearing layered skirts with fine embroidery. She is a [[Sunol/Races#Tieflings\|tiefling]], with dark red skin and totally silver eyes with no visible sclera. Her curly brown hair is twisted into many very long, tight braids and big, smooth horns come from her forehead and curve up and back. She is incredibly light on her feet, seeming to barely touch the ground.

She is even-tempered, but intimidating, with an uncommonly brilliant mind. She has intimate arcane knowledge, especially for a bard, and can play almost any instrument.
