Obscure is an adventurer, part of the [[Guilds/Blood Oath\|Blood Oath]] adventuring party run out of the [[Guilds/Banner Vale Adventurers Guild\|Banner Vale Adventurers Guild]] in [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Eversun\|Eversun]].

She is a [[Sunol/Races#Tieflings\|tiefling]] rogue who wears leather armour and always has a dagger on her belt. She has dark scaly skin, totally white eyes, and straight black and grey hair that falls down past her shoulders. Large, segmented horns sweep backwards from her head.

She has an almost supernatural awareness of her surroundings and an uncanny ability to hide and sneak up on people, which serves her well as a rogue and has garnered her a reputation as someone not to be trusted. She is known for being quite snarky and sarcastic, and to let her party leader, [[Characters/Guild Members/Banner Vale/Gerard Winchester\|Gerard Winchester]], talk for her in official situations.
