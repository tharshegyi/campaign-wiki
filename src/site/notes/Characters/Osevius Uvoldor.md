Osevius Uvoldor is a well-respected but very eccentric hedge wizard from the city of [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Eversun\|Eversun]].

He graduated valedictorian of his year at [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Eversun Academy\|Eversun Academy]] many years previous, and now runs a small magical shop of magic items and spell services called 'Osevius' Oddities' in the [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Eversun#Trades District\|Trades District]] of [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Eversun\|Eversun]].

Osevius wears threadbare mystic robes and carries a number of books and scrolls lashed to his waist, and even more in his hands. He has pale skin, green almond-shaped eyes, and medium-length wavy dark brown hair. 

He is a tall, almost too thin [[Sunol/Races#Eladren\|Eladren]] man, that speaks incredibly quickly, almost as if his brain is moving too quickly for his mouth. He is not mean, but he is very blunt in the way he speaks.
