Brida Harbotle is the Mayor of the small town of [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Ruin Hills#Arden\|Arden]] in the [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Ruin Hills\|Ruin Hills]]

Brida dresses in fine, but persistently dirty, clothing, and is constantly carrying a number of papers, parchments, and scrolls. He has pale skin and brown eyes and short, thinning, wavy dark brown hair. He is 75 years old and quite small, even for a [[Sunol/Races#The Small Races\|halfling]], and has a kind smile. He insists that everyone in town call him Brida.

He gives smart, sage advice that everyone in town listens to, and believes the tried and true traditional way is best and is humble. He believes you should set a good example for others. He is a devout follower of [[Beiria/The Gods/The Ten\|The Ten]], and personally prays daily to [[Beiria/The Gods/The Mother\|The Mother]] for mercy and guidance.
