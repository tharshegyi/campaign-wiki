A member of the [[Characters/Skyreach Council/Skyreach Council\|Skyreach Council]], run out of the district of [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Brightstone#Skyhill\|Skyhill]] in Northeastern [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Brightstone\|Brightstone]].

Owner of '[[Entities/The Stone Factory\|The Stone Factory]]', a merchant company that deals in stones and stoneworks, also some gemstones. He does a lot of buisness in [[Sunol/The Red Basin/Vein's End\|Vein's End]] but spends the majority of his time in [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Brightstone\|Brightstone]], if he can help it.

Baldric is well-dressed and carries a ledger under his arm. He is a stocky [[Sunol/Races#Dwarves\|Dwarven]] man, with deep brown skin and deep-set hazel eyes. His medium-length thinning, curly black and gray hair is put up in braids. He has a medium-length black and gray beard. He is of average height for a [[Sunol/Races#Dwarves\|Dwarf]], and surprisingly well built for his occupation.

He sometimes has a gut feeling about things, and is often correct. He believes it is important to take responsibility and he does wish people would be more in touch with the natural world.
