Wife of [[Characters/Skyreach Council/Roisin Silverborn\|Roisin Silverborn]], the unofficial head of the [[Characters/Skyreach Council/Skyreach Council\|Skyreach Council]] in [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Brightstone\|Brightstone]] 
Ephsi Silverborn's clothing is the height of extravagance - the finest silks, furs, and jewellery. She has pale skin, blue eyes, and medium-length wavy red hair. She is 28 years old, quite slim and pretty, and quite tall for a [[Sunol/Races#Humans\|Human]] female, almost 6ft.

She is very well-educated, but nondescript and forgettable. She believes it is important to act respectably and have power over others.
