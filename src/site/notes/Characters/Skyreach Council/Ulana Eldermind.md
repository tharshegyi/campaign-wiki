A member of the [[Characters/Skyreach Council/Skyreach Council\|Skyreach Council]], run out of the district of [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Brightstone#Skyhill\|Skyhill]] in Northeastern [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Brightstone\|Brightstone]].

Ulana Eldermind, a female [[Sunol/Races#Eladren\|Eladren]], owns a number of forges across the continent, as part of a company called '[[Entities/The Elder Forges\|The Elder Forges]]'. The flagship forge is run out of the [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Brightstone#Glass Forge\|Glass Forge district]] of [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Brightstone\|Brightstone]]. These forges all focus on the production of fine jewellery and ornate armours, though do allow their use (at a price) to other blacksmiths selling other wares.

Ulana's clothing is the height of extravagance - the finest silks, furs, and jewellery. She has bronze skin and golden almond-shaped eyes that sparkle like stars. Her wavy blond hair is tied in a very long braid. She is fairly strong, with corded muscles honed from her time forging jewellery herself.

She is quite intelligent. She believes it is important to be unbiased and she likes to influence others. She believes everyone should mind their own business.
