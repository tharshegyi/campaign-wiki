A member of the [[Characters/Skyreach Council/Skyreach Council\|Skyreach Council]], run out of the district of [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Brightstone#Skyhill\|Skyhill]] in Northeastern [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Brightstone\|Brightstone]].

Farro Allathrir owns ‘[[Entities/Allathrir Fleets\|Allathrir Fleets]]’, a large company that deals in ships and transports and has a reputation for ruthlessness on the waters. He is the third generation Allathrir to run the business, and keeps a home in [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Brightstone\|Brightstone]] despite the fact that most of his fleet docks in [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Eversun\|Eversun]] where his family originally lived and he studied at [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Eversun Academy\|Eversun Academy]].

Farro is a tall [[Sunol/Races#Eladren\|Eladren]] man, that wears exquisite clothing and has a nasty whip perpetually hanging from his belt. He has ivory skin and blue almond-shaped eyes that sparkle like stars. He has medium-length wavy light brown hair and is fairly slim, and looks to be around middle aged.

He is very smart, and condescending to others. He believes it is important to obey authority and have others look up to you. He believes being correct is more important than having an open mind.
