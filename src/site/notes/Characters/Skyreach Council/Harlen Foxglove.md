Harlen wears fine clothes. He is a [[Sunol/Races#Humans\|Human]] man with ruddy skin, blue eyes, and short, thinning, straight black and gray hair and a short black and gray beard. He is easily startled and jumpy. He is average sized and relatively unassuming, but with a sharp stare.

He likes to influence others and believes it is important to be cunning. He believes cleanliness is a waste of time - it'll just get dirty again.
