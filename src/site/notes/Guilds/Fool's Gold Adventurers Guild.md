Fool’s Gold Adventurers Guild is run by guildmaster [[Characters/Guild Members/Fool's Gold/Baldus Talvion\|Baldus Talvion]] and his wife [[Characters/Guild Members/Fool's Gold/Marigold Talvion\|Marigold Talvion]], along with their old cat, [[Characters/Guild Members/Fool's Gold/Copper\|Copper]]. Fool's Gold occasionally works with, and considers itself a 'sister guild' to [[Guilds/Twin Rats Adventurers Guild\|Twin Rats Adventurers Guild]] in [[Sunol/The Red Basin/Vein's End\|Vein's End]], where it sometimes sends adventurers to assist in disturbances in the [[Sunol/The Red Basin/Red Basin\|Red Basin]].

The guildhall is an old wooden 4-story building, just off a main road in the Northern [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Eversun#Trades District\|Trades District]] of [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Eversun\|Eversun]], with an ornate, oversized gold coin hanging outside.

Fool’s Gold guild hall opens into a large room dominated by three long wooden tables and benches, where adventurers can socialise and drink amongst themselves. Along the back wall, [[Characters/Guild Members/Fool's Gold/Baldus Talvion\|Baldus Talvion]], the guild master, is often seated in a plush armchair behind a desk in front of a notice board for guild quests.

To the right of the hall is an old bar that is tended by [[Characters/Guild Members/Fool's Gold/Marigold Talvion\|Marigold]], [[Characters/Guild Members/Fool's Gold/Baldus Talvion\|Baldus]]’ wife. She serves fresh, home-made stew and bread to her adventurers, most every afternoon. Cross stitches, doilies, and hand knitted blankets decorate the walls and chairs of the guildhall, all personally made by [[Characters/Guild Members/Fool's Gold/Marigold Talvion\|Marigold]].

Those who are registered as an adventurer at Fool's Gold carry an intricately stamped gold coin.

There are a few notable adventuring parties out of Fool's Gold, including:
- [[Guilds/The Foragers\|The Foragers]]
- [[Guilds/Ironquill\|Ironquill]]
