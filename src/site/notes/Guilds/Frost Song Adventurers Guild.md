Frost Song Adventurers Guild is a primarily magic-user guild based out of the [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Brightstone#Rose gate\|Rose Gate]] district of [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Brightstone\|Brightstone]]. It is run by the head mage and guildmaster [[Characters/Guild Members/Frost Song/Fildaerae Maghorn\|Fildaerae Maghorn]].

The guild has a reputation for advancing magic more than completing generic adventuring tasks. When a particularly important magical task is required, the Frost Song Adventurers Guild is the first point of call.

The most prominent adventuring party out of Frost Song is [[Guilds/The Inkwell Society\|The Inkwell Society]].
