The Twin Rats Adventurers Guild is the only significant guild operating in Northern [[Sunol/Sunol\|Sunol]], with a guildhall based in [[Sunol/The Red Basin/Vein's End#The Scrapyards\|The Scrapyards]] of [[Sunol/The Red Basin/Vein's End\|Vein's End]]. The guildmaster [[Characters/Guild Members/Twin Rats/Thornick Varn\|Thornick "Twin-Eye" Varn]] grew up in [[Sunol/The Red Basin/Vein's End\|Vein's End]] and has made it his mission to make the [[Sunol/The Red Basin/Red Basin\|Red Basin]] a better place.

The guild works closely with, and considers itself a 'sister guild' to the [[Guilds/Fool's Gold Adventurers Guild\|Fool's Gold Adventurers Guild]] in [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Eversun\|Eversun]]. The two guilds occasionally call on each other for help, particularly Twin Rats when there is a big quest in the desert as the guild is much smaller.

Twin Rats does a lot of work servicing [[Sunol/The Red Basin/Vein's End\|Vein's End]] and the surrounding [[Sunol/The Red Basin/Red Basin\|Red Basin]] desert, particularly a lot of mercenary and escort work. Stationed in [[Sunol/The Red Basin/Vein's End#The Scrapyards\|The Scrapyards]] district, near the Oasis Markets, guild memebers are often called to ‘police’ the markets, pushing out the black market traders and stopping fights.

There are few adventurers that stay part of a single party for long in Twin Rats, as many are only staying in [[Sunol/The Red Basin/Vein's End\|Vein's End]] transiently. A number of parties are being made and being disbanded in the guild at any given time. One party that is consistent in the guild is the guildmaster's own: [[Guilds/The Sandguard\|The Sandguard]].
