Owned by [[Characters/Skyreach Council/Harlen Foxglove\|Harlen Foxglove]], one of the members of the [[Characters/Skyreach Council/Skyreach Council\|Skyreach Council]], Foxglove Apothecaries deals primarily in poisons and antidotes.

Run out of the [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Brightstone#Rose gate\|Rose Gate district]] of [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Brightstone\|Brightstone]], [[Characters/Skyreach Council/Harlen Foxglove\|Harlen Foxglove]] and his 'apprentices' corner the market on rare poisons and their even rarer antidotes. Some say that his ability to sell poisons to which he is the only one who sells antidotes is somewhat 'predatory', but [[Characters/Skyreach Council/Harlen Foxglove\|Harlen]] believes that that is 'just good buisness'.
