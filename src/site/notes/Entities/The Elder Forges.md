Owned by [[Characters/Skyreach Council/Ulana Eldermind\|Ulana Eldermind]], one of the members of the [[Characters/Skyreach Council/Skyreach Council\|Skyreach Council]], The Elder Forges are a collection of associated forges that both employ skilled craftsmen and rent out spaces for private individuals to produce and maintain their wares.

The flagship forge is run out of the [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Brightstone#Glass Forge\|Glass Forge district]] of [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Brightstone\|Brightstone]]. These forges all focus on the production of fine jewellery and ornate armours, though do allow their use (at a price) to other blacksmiths selling other wares.
