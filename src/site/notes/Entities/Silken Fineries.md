Owned by [[Characters/Skyreach Council/Legend\|Legend]], one of the members of the [[Characters/Skyreach Council/Skyreach Council\|Skyreach Council]], Silken Fineries is a bustling tailoring business, which deals in fine silks and finer clothing. It is run primarily out of the district of [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Brightstone#Skyhill\|Skyhill]] in Northeastern [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Brightstone\|Brightstone]].

Silken Fineries employs a large warehouse of workers, mostly those who come in from the [[Sunol/The Red Basin/Red Basin\|Red Basin]] looking for work. Those who do well in the company get fair pay and good accomodation. 

[[Characters/Skyreach Council/Legend\|Legend]] is known for her ability to craft the finest quality clothing around, when the mood strikes her. She also has a number of finely trained tailors that work under her, producing the best quality clothing (besides that which [[Characters/Skyreach Council/Legend\|Legend]] makes herself) that can be found in all of [[Sunol/Sunol\|Sunol]].
