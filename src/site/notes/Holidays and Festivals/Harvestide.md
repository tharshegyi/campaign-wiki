Harvestide, or 'The Harvest Feast' is an additional day of the [[Sunol/Sunol#Calendar of Zyklus\|Calendar of Zyklus]], that falls between Aratas 30 and Multar 1 (the 9th and 10th months of the year). It occurs on the 274th day of the year on a non leap year, or the 275th day on a leap year.

This holiday is traditionally a feast to celebrate the harvest and the abundance of food, but also the time when those wishing to travel leave on their journeys before winter set in.

Preparations for the feast started as early as a ten days before on the [[Holidays and Festivals/Autumn Equinox\|Autumn Equinox]], in acts of foraging/harvesting, preparing, cooking, and preserving food for the cold winter months. On the day of Harvestide, a huge feast is prepared, either in the home or as part of a community. Farming communities often host fairs, where games and contests such as eating and strength competitions are put on, along with challenges of skill. It is also a day for charity, where churches and volunteers will distribute food and goods to the poor.

This holiday is important to followers of [[Beiria/The Gods/The Mother\|The Mother]], for families, compassion, and charity, and in some spaces important to [[Beiria/The Gods/The Jester\|The Jester]], as people set off on their journeys, taken by the [[Beiria/The Gods/The Jester\|Jester]]'s wind
