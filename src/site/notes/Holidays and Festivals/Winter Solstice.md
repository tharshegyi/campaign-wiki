The Winter Solstice, or 'The Calm Night' is a widely recognised holiday on the [[Sunol/Sunol#Calendar of Zyklus\|Calendar of Zyklus]], that falls on Lenior 20 (the 12th month of the year). It occurs on the 355th day of the year during a non-leap year, or the 356th day of a leap year.

The solstice is celebrated after dark, when the stars are visible across the sky. Celebrants locate stars associated with their own births, or with their ancestors. Those without a lucky star can purchase star maps from street merchants to help divine which belonged to them, based on when and where they were born.

This holiday is celebrated outside, with people trying to stay awake the entire night, gathered around bonfires with plenty of music, food, and warm drinks from travelling merchants. It is considered a time to welcome back the light, as the days get longer from here on.

The solstice an important night to followers of all of [[Beiria/The Gods/The Ten\|The Ten]], as one of the two festival nights in winter. It is important for bringing joy in the dark months, and checking in with family during this time.
