The Autumn Equinox is a widely recognised holiday on the [[Sunol/Sunol#Calendar of Zyklus\|Calendar of Zyklus]], that falls on Aratas 21 (the 9th month of the year). It occurs on the 264th day of the year on a non leap year, or the 265th day on a leap year.

The Autum Equinox, a day of equal day and night, is celebrated as a holiday of dance and early harvest in [[Sunol/Sunol\|Sunol]]. It starts a time of harvesting and foraging in preparation for the massive feast of [[Holidays and Festivals/Harvestide\|Harvestide]] in 10 days time. This is also a traditional time to harvest medicinal supplies, and as such is highly anticipated in [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/Annette's Rest\|Annette's Rest]], where medicinal scholars from [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Eversun\|Eversun]] and trainees from the Healer's School there travel in to [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/The Witches Woods\|The Witches Woods]] for the largest yearly gathering of medicinal supplies in [[Sunol/Sunol\|Sunol]].

The [[Sunol/Central Sunol/Eversun Academy\|Eversun Academy]] is a great benefactor of the holiday, running an excursion of medical students to [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/Annette's Rest\|Annette's Rest]] each year on this holiday to participate in this traditional harvest and maintain strong ties with [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/Southern Sunol\|Southern Sunol]].

This holiday is incredibly important to followers of [[Beiria/The Gods/The Healer\|The Healer]], which constitutes most of the population of [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/Annette's Rest\|Annette's Rest]]. Devotees from other parts of the continent will also frequently make the trek to [[Sunol/Southern Sunol/The Witches Woods\|The Witches Woods]] for the harvest.
