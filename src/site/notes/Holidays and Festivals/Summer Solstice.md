The Summer Solstice, commonly known as 'The Short Night' is a widely recognised holiday on the [[Sunol/Sunol#Calendar of Zyklus\|Calendar of Zyklus]], that falls on Meridium 20 (the 6th month of the year). It occurs on the 172nd day of the year.

This holiday is the longest day of the year, with [[Sunol/Sunol\|Sunol]] seeing nearly 16 hours of daylight. The Short Night festival starts at dusk, and lasts the 8 hours of the holiday spent in darkness. Festival-goers celebrate by lighting bonfires to ward off evil spirits, creating floral crowns, dancing around meridumpoles, and gathering at dawn to honour the sun's energy. It is often marked by young and old leaving out flowers and snacks for those celebrating during the night, in thanks for keeping the bonfires lit to ward off the spirits while they sleep.
