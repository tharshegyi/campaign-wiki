The Spring Equinox, known to some as 'Fay Day', is a widely recognised holiday on the [[Sunol/Sunol#Calendar of Zyklus\|Calendar of Zyklus]], that falls on Nanethia 19 (the 3rd month of the year). It occurs on the 80th day of the year.

It is a day marked to celebrate nature and thankfulness, and also believed to be the time of the year when the veil between this world and the Feywild is at its thinnest. Some mark this holiday by entering the forests for foraging and dance in the fine weather, while others mark this day with suspicion and trepidation, avoiding the forests to not invite any fae in, and leaving treats by their front doors to appease any visitors from the other plane.

The major cities of [[Sunol/Sunol\|Sunol]] all hold market days on the Spring Equinox, where small tokens to leave for the fae are sold and themed foods are often made. Dancers and other performers often take to the streets on these days, as tips tend to be more generous. Some believe that the performers could be visiting fae, and one should not insult them with a poor tip.

Fay Day important to followers of [[Beiria/The Gods/The Crone\|The Crone]] as goddess of nature, and followers of [[Beiria/The Gods/The Jester\|The Jester]].
