Midsummer, also known as 'Love's Night', is an additional day of the [[Sunol/Sunol#Calendar of Zyklus\|Calendar of Zyklus]], that falls between Ignisar 30 and Luminara 1 (the 7th and 8th months of the year). It occurs on the 213th day of the year.

Love's Night is a festival that is celebrated with feasts, music, and love. It is considered a holiday for love and couples, where betrothals are often highly encouraged. Couples often take advantage of the warm Midsummer weather to have picnics in the forests and spend the afternoon watching musical entertainment and wandering through markets set up for the day.

Familial love is also celebrated on this day, with some families hosting big feasts and celebrating the day with wine. Some more liberal followers of [[Beiria/The Gods/The Lady\|The Lady]] can take this day as an excuse to celebrate a more physical love.

This day is important to followers of [[Beiria/The Gods/The Lady\|The Lady]] and [[Beiria/The Gods/The Jester\|The Jester]], considered a time to be appreciative of love, beauty, and music.
