Hyraniea is the northernmost country of [[Beiria/Sukrea/Sukrea\|Sukrea]], sharing a border with [[Beiria/Sukrea/Ereni\|Ereni]] to the south. It is known for its cold and harsh winters, making the Hyraniean people big importers of [[Sunol/Sunolusite\|Sunolusite]] when ships are able to make the trip to the northern coast, or traders are able to make their way to the shores of [[Sunol/Sunol\|Sunol]] to bring the warming gemstone home.

Hyraniea is buffered from the affect of the [[Beiria/Sukrea/Kingdom of Zaradorn\|Kingdom of Zaradorn]] by the country [[Beiria/Sukrea/Ereni\|Ereni]], which sits between itself and the [[Beiria/Sukrea/Kingdom of Zaradorn\|Kingdom]]. It is a theocracy, worshipping a dual god likened to [[Beiria/The Gods/The Father\|The Father]] and [[Beiria/The Gods/The Mother\|The Mother]], and governed by King Drithas Omaro. It is currently in a defensive pact with other countries of [[Beiria/Sukrea/Sukrea\|Sukrea]] against the [[Beiria/Sukrea/Kingdom of Zaradorn\|Kingdom of Zaradorn]], to try and slow its expansion into their lands.

The Hyraniean accent is very fast-paced, and these quick talking people are known for their fine warm clothes and furs, which they have perfected the craft of in the frigid north.
