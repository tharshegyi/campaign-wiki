Ereni is a large country that borders on the southeast with [[Beiria/Sukrea/Kingdom of Zaradorn\|Kingdom of Zaradorn]] and the north with [[Beiria/Sukrea/Hyraniea\|Hyraniea]]. It is currently in a defensive pact with other countries of [[Beiria/Sukrea/Sukrea\|Sukrea]] against the [[Beiria/Sukrea/Kingdom of Zaradorn\|Kingdom of Zaradorn]], to try and slow its expansion into their lands.

The land is predominantly covered in marshland, with deciduous forest to the North, mountains to the North-East, and fertile woodland to the North-West. It is only its eastern mountain ranges that have slowed the spread of the [[Beiria/Sukrea/Kingdom of Zaradorn\|Kingdom of Zaradorn]] into Erenian lands.

Ereni is known for their furniture, where this country renowned for its unique and one-of-a-kind pieces. Little trade or interaction happens directly between Ereni and [[Sunol/Sunol\|Sunol]], as it is both land-locked and closest to the coast on the Zaradornian side, however Erenian furniture still makes it's way to [[Sunol/Sunol\|Sunol]] through other countries.
