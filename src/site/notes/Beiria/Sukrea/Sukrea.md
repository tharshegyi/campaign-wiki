Sukrea is a massive supercontinent to the North East of [[Sunol/Sunol\|Sunol]], that is largely controlled by an Aasimar supremacist monarchy, the [[Beiria/Sukrea/Kingdom of Zaradorn\|Kingdom of Zaradorn]]. The Kingdom spans the entire western coast of Sukrea, making trade from Sunol to any inland countries nearly impossible. Slavery of non-Aasimar races is incredibly common in the Kingdom, particularly of the native coastal Genasi.

Limited trade happens between the two continents, with primarily fine goods such as [[Sunol/Sunolusite\|Sunolusite]] being exported from [[Sunol/Sunol\|Sunol]] to Sukrea for large sums of gold. While a lot of the trade goods come through the [[Beiria/Sukrea/Kingdom of Zaradorn\|Kingdom of Zaradorn]], some trade with the other countries of the continent happens between them and [[Sunol/Sunol\|Sunol]].

Other countries in Sukrea form a defensive pact against the expansionist [[Beiria/Sukrea/Kingdom of Zaradorn\|Kingdom of Zaradorn]], and historically have not taken any part in its wars with other islands and continents on [[Beiria/Beiria\|Beiria]].

Countries on the continent of Sukrea include:
The [[Beiria/Sukrea/Kingdom of Zaradorn\|Kingdom of Zaradorn]]
[[Beiria/Sukrea/Ereni\|Ereni]]
[[Beiria/Sukrea/Hyraniea\|Hyraniea]]
[[Beiria/Sukrea/Vaanes Republic\|Vaanes Republic]]
