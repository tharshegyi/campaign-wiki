The Kingdom spans the entire western coast of [[Beiria/Sukrea/Sukrea\|Sukrea]]. It is an expansionist Aasimar supremacist monarchy, that is known for its brutality. The Aasimar people of the Kingdom justify their supremacy by exultation of their god-blood, and see the other races as inferior for their lack. Slavery of non-Aasimar races is incredibly common in the Kingdom, particularly of the native coastal Genasi.

There is no one culture attributed to the Kingdom, as it has assimilated many cultures over centuries due to its size and expansionist nature. The central capital city of Ayldim is almost entirely Aasimir, and the seat from which the King Veilter Zaradorn rules. The entirety of the Kingdom spans across almost all biomes, from desert in the south to snow-capped mountains in the north.

The Kingdom of Zaradorn is currently in an uneasy peacetime with the continent of [[Sunol/Sunol\|Sunol]], after the end of the [[Beiria/War of the Great Sea\|War of the Great Sea]].
