Beira is the first planet in [[Beiria/The Sol System\|The Sol System]] circling the sun Sol. Beiria is an earth-like planet with liquid water and four seasons in most areas. It has two poles that hold ice for most of the year. This planet has two moons commonly called [[Beiria/The Moons/Naneth\|Naneth]] and [[Beiria/The Moons/Adar\|Adar]], old elvish names for [[Beiria/The Gods/The Mother\|The Mother]] and [[Beiria/The Gods/The Father\|The Father]], respectively.

Beiria is slightly smaller than Earth, with an equatorial circumference of about 22,000 miles, about 0.88 times Earth size. The planet has a few large continents, the moderately sized [[Sunol/Sunol\|Sunol]] to the east, the central supercontinent [[Beiria/Sukrea/Sukrea\|Sukrea]], and two sister continents with relatively unknown histories, [[Beiria/Ekeon\|Ekeon]] and [[Beiria/Noros\|Noros]], to the northwest.
