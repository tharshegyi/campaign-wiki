The Gods - The Ten
The Ten are the main Gods of Sunol, who are each divided in sets of two Gods/Goddesses that 'balance' each other.

Individuals in Sunol may follow one or many of the gods. While some of the Gods may be more common among certain races/geographical locations, you can find a follower of The Ten almost anywhere. A common religious greeting on the continent is 'Ten Blessings be upon you'.

The Ten Blessings:
'May the Father judge you kindly
May the Mother fill your cup
May the Lady be your muse
May the Crone guide your way
May the Smith lend you skill
May the Scholar grant you knowledge
May the Soldier keep you safe
May the Healer keep you well
May the Jester give you favour
And May the Stranger guide you gently'
