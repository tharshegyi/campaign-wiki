Naneth is the smaller of the two moons of [[Beiria/Beiria\|Beiria]], and the old elvish name for [[Beiria/The Gods/The Mother\|The Mother]].

This moon is much smaller than its partner moon [[Beiria/The Moons/Adar\|Adar]], however orbits much closer and faster than the other moon. Naneth orbits on an approximate day-night cycle, most often only being seen at night time from the surface of [[Beiria/Beiria\|Beiria]]. 

Naneth works on a 33 day lunar cycle, with 8 phases:
New Moon: Naneth is between the Sun and [[Beiria/Beiria\|Beiria]]; the illuminated side faces away from [[Beiria/Beiria\|Beiria]].
Waxing Crescent: A small sliver of light appears on the right side of Naneth
First Quarter: The right half of the Naneth is illuminated.
Waxing Gibbous: More than half of Naneth is illuminated and continues growing.
Full Moon: [[Beiria/Beiria\|Beiria]] is between the Sun and Naneth, fully illuminating the side facing [[Beiria/Beiria\|Beiria]]
Waning Gibbous: The light begins to decrease, moving from full to half.
Third/Last Quarter: The left half of Naneth is illuminated.
Waning Crescent: A small sliver of light remains on the left side of Naneth before disappearing.
