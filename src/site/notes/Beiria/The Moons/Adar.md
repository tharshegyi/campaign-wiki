Adar is the larger of the two moons of [[Beiria/Beiria\|Beiria]], and the old elvish name for [[Beiria/The Gods/The Father\|The Father]].

This moon is quite a bit larger than its partner moon [[Beiria/The Moons/Naneth\|Naneth]], about two times the size, though orbits further away and therefore looks only about 25% bigger when on [[Beiria/Beiria\|Beiria]]. Adar orbits the planet slowly, and therefore stays in the sky for the days and nights for about 3 days on, 3 days off. When Adar is is visible, the nights are significantly brighter and tides higher for those 3 days.

Adar works on a 99 day lunar cycle, with 8 phases, mimicking the cycle of [[Beiria/The Moons/Naneth\|Naneth]] but 3 times longer, along with the 3 day presence/absence cycle around [[Beiria/Beiria\|Beiria]].

This leads to lunar times such as:
Waxing cresent [[Beiria/The Moons/Naneth\|Naneth]] and waning cresent Adar, absent
