The War of the Great Sea was a long and drawn out conflict between the [[Beiria/Sukrea/Kingdom of Zaradorn\|Kingdom of Zaradorn]] in [[Beiria/Sukrea/Sukrea\|Sukrea]], and the people of the continent of [[Sunol/Sunol\|Sunol]]. It spanned from the year 1329 to the year 1383 ZE, lasting 54 years and ending only 32 years ago.

As the name implies, this war was mostly fought in the open waters of the [[Sunol/Sunol#Oceans of Sunol\|Great Sea]] between the two continents, though a number of battles were fought on the eastern shores of [[Sunol/Sunol\|Sunol]].

The [[Beiria/Sukrea/Kingdom of Zaradorn\|Kingdom of Zaradorn]] were the aggressors in this war, having expanded far into the [[Sunol/Sunol#Oceans of Sunol\|Great Sea]] over centuries to establish outposts, capture slaves, and assimilate cultures of many of the smaller nations on islands between the two large continents. The war began after the [[Beiria/Sukrea/Kingdom of Zaradorn\|Kingdom of Zaradorn]] pushed too far west, threatening the shores of [[Sunol/Sunol\|Sunol]] and interfering with fishing and trade. It started as a series of small skirmishes at sea, with fishing vessels being attacked and naval vessels aiding calls and finding themselves in larger and larger conflicts.

The [[Beiria/Sukrea/Kingdom of Zaradorn\|Kingdom of Zaradorn]] managed to make land on [[Sunol/Sunol\|Sunol]] 14 times in the 54 year conflict, with each landing ending in a victory for [[Sunol/Sunol\|Sunol]] and the repelling of the Kingdom's forces for some years.

After heavy losses on both sides, the monarchs for the [[Beiria/Sukrea/Kingdom of Zaradorn\|Kingdom of Zaradorn]] and [[Sunol/Sunol\|Sunol]] met at sea to discuss the terms of a peace that now stands between the two. The late Sunolian King Caspian Ambrose, father of current [[Characters/The Court/King William Ambrose\|King William Ambrose]], brokered the peace with the still current King Veilter Zaradorn of the [[Beiria/Sukrea/Kingdom of Zaradorn\|Kingdom of Zaradorn]].
